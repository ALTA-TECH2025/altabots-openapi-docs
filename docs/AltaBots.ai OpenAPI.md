# **API Reference Overview**

The AltaBots API allows you to programmatically interact with your AI agents, manage conversations, access knowledge bases, and integrate AltaBots capabilities into your own applications and systems.

## **API Basics**

### **Base URL**

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://altatech.ai/v1
```

### **Authentication**

All API requests require authentication via an API key.

#### **How to Generate an API Key**

* **For Agent-related usage**  
   Navigate to: `Agent > Integrations > API Key` in your AltaBots dashboard to create an API key specific to the Agent you are working with.

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

### **Request Format**

Most API endpoints accept JSON-encoded request bodies. Make sure to include the following header in your requests:

```
Content-Type: application/json
```

### **Response Format**

All responses are returned in JSON format. A typical response structure includes:

```
{
  "data": { ... },  // The response data
  "meta": { ... },  // Metadata about the response
  "links": { ... }  // Links for pagination or related resources
}
```

### **Error Handling**

When an error occurs, the API returns an appropriate HTTP status code and a JSON response with error details:

```
{
  "error": {
    "code": "error_code",
    "message": "A human-readable error message",
    "status": 400  // The HTTP status code
  }
}
```

## **Rate Limits**

API rate limits vary by subscription plan:

* Free Tier: 100 requests per day  
* Professional: 1,000 requests per hour  
* Enterprise: Custom limits based on contract

Rate limit information is included in the response headers:

* X-RateLimit-Limit: The maximum number of requests allowed in the current period
